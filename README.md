Project Title: Basic File Management Utility in C++

Project Duration: Approximately 3 hours

Objective:
Create a simple command-line file management utility in C++ that performs basic file operations such as copying, moving, and deleting files. This project aims to help you get familiar with C++ syntax and basic file handling concepts.

Requirements:
1. Command-Line Interface:
   Create a user-friendly command-line interface that allows the user to input commands and parameters.

2. File Copying:
   Implement a function that copies a source file to a destination directory. The function should handle cases where the source file does not exist or the destination directory is invalid.

3. File Moving:
   Implement a function that moves a source file to a destination directory. Like the copying function, handle cases of missing source files and invalid destination directories.

4. File Deleting:
   Implement a function that deletes a specified file. Handle cases where the file doesn't exist.

5. Error Handling:
   Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms using exceptions or return codes to ensure the program gracefully handles invalid inputs or unexpected errors.

6. User Instructions:
   Display clear and concise instructions to the user on how to use your utility. Provide examples of valid commands and their expected outcomes.

7. Makefile (Optional):
   Create a simple Makefile to compile your C++ program into an executable.

8. Documentation (Optional):
   Include comments in your code to explain the purpose of functions, variables, and any complex logic. You can also create a brief README file that explains how to build and run your program.

Suggested Steps:
1. Set up your C++ development environment. If you don't already have one, you can use tools like g++ to compile your code.

2. Plan your program's structure and create the necessary functions to perform file operations.

3. Implement the command-line interface to take user input and parse commands.

4. Develop the file copying, moving, and deleting functions.

5. Implement error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues.

6. Test your program with different scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs.

7. If time allows, consider improving the user experience with better error messages, advanced error handling, or additional features.

8. Ensure your code is well-commented and organized before considering the project complete.

Keep in mind that the given timeframe of 3 hours is relatively short, so focus on implementing the core functionality first. You can always expand and improve the project later if you wish. Good luck!
